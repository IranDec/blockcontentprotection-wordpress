# Changelog

All notable changes to Block Content Protection will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.6] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- **Video Play Button**: Resolved an issue where the transparent overlay intended to block download managers was also preventing the video's play button from being clicked. The overlay now correctly passes the click event to the video player.
- **Screen Recording Block**: Fixed a major bug where enabling the screen recording block would cause the video to be blacked out in all situations. The feature has been refactored to a simpler, more reliable CSS-based approach that only activates when a screen recording is detected.

### Changed
- Refactored the screen recording detection JavaScript for better reliability and maintainability.
